       <p>
         <b>Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) </b>is a branch of science applied to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases using clinical laboratory tests. This involves analysing body matter, including fluid, tissue and blood using microorganism screening, chemical analysis and cell count. This branch has two prime career options, including medical laboratory technologists and technicians. A technologist performs most of their tasks such as preparation of slides, human tissues or other specimens, using laboratory equipment. On the other hand, medical laboratory technicians help MLTs and carry out tasks such as blood tests and blood typing.
