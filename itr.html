       <p>
         <b>Radiotherapy</b> also called radiation therapy, is the treatment of cancer and other diseases with ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy that injures or destroys cells in the area being treated (the "target tissue") by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow. Radiotherapy may be used to treat localized solid tumours, such as cancers of the skin, tongue, larynx, brain, breast, or uterine cervix. It can also be used to treat leukaemia and lymphoma (cancers of the blood-forming cells and lymphatic system, respectively). The course provides many job options after its completion along with further studies.
